# GrassRando

A Hollow Knight mod that randomizes the grass in the game.

Inspired by the streamer Skurry after watching them talk about other Hollow Knight randomizers.

NOTE: This randomizer mod is a work in progress, it is currently not completable as the logic for the grass has not been completed

NOTE 2: This randomizer mod is a work in progress, some of the grass randomly will not drop the item it is holding. Ever.
