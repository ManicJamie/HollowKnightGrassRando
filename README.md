# GrassRando

A Hollow Knight mod that randomizes the grass in the game.

Inspired by the streamer Skurry after watching them talk about other Hollow Knight randomizers.

NOTE: This randomizer mod is a work in progress, it is likely currently not completable as the logic for the grass locaitons has not been completed.

NOTE 2: This randomizer mod is a work in progress, some of the grass randomly will not drop the item it is holding. Ever.

NOTE 3: This rando does not currently have a way of dealing with the quantum grass, the dream realm grasses, or the infected crossroads grass.

I would also like to thanks the developers of the Grass% mod (GrassyKnight) as their grass list did help reduce the amount of time spent locating all of the grass within the game

# TODO
* complete the logic for the rando
* add a grass shop for all the grass you've collected
* see if the lag from breaking grass can be reduced
* on a related note: see if the hit instance from hitting broken grass can be prevented
