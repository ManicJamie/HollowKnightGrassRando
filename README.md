# GrassRando

A Hollow Knight mod that randomizes the grass in the game.

Inspired by the streamer Skurry after watching them talk about other Hollow Knight randomizers.

NOTE: I tried my best to make sure the randomizer had correct logic all the way through. HOWEVER, there are over 3000 "items" being randomized and that makes it quite complex to get the logic 100% correct.

NOTE 2: This rando does not currently have a way of dealing with the quantum grass.

NOTE 3: If the dream grass is enabled, make sure you get all of it in both the dream boss fights and the dream nail collection scene. I DID NOT IMPLEMENT A FAILSAFE FOR THIS.

NOTE 4: You currently have to break all of the grass with your nail to get the drops. I am looking for a way to fix this without tanking the frames.

I would also like to thanks the developers of the Grass% mod (GrassyKnight) as their grass list did help reduce the amount of time spent locating all of the grass within the game
